# Firebase Cloud Function Promise Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Cloud Functions related to incorrect promise handling.  The provided `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, which results in unexpected behavior and potential data inconsistency. The corrected version in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to properly handle promises to avoid these issues.

## Description

The bug arises from an improper return statement in an asynchronous Cloud Function.  The function may terminate prematurely, and critical operations may not be executed if the function is handling promises incorrectly.  This can lead to unpredictable results and data corruption.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly structuring the promise chain using `async/await` or `.then().catch()` to ensure that all operations are handled before the function completes.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with detailed comments.
